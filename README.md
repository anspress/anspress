## Description ##
Zen Projects and Rahul have agreed to team up to bring substantial resources into the development of AnsPress and its related themes and extensions, read the full announcement here: https://anspress.net/blog/anspress-update-annoucement/

AnsPress is an open source, developer friendly, question and answer plugin for WordPress. AnsPress adds a full question and answer system to your existing WordPress site. It can be used to create a Q&A network similar to StackOverflow and Quora, or be a single page on existing site. The plugin supports multiple languages, shortcodes, reCAPTCHA, email and push notifications, and more.

AnsPress is not just limited to questions and answers. It can be used in many different ways, like a bug tracker, an internal Q&A board, support ticket forum, FAQ, and more. Anspress is trusted and used by many popular companies and sites at scale.

**Performance and Optimizations:**

In our latest release, we've made big improvements to performance and have tested the plugin in many different server environments. It has run smoothly on every type of server with minimal impact on load times. AnsPress (including all of its functionalities) is very fast compared to other Q&A plugins. In the latest release we have made major improvements to reduce MySQL queries and to increase the page load speed for all page templates within the plugin.

**Developer Friendly:**

AnsPress is built with developers in mind and can easily be extended to fit your needs. All parts of the template layouts can be overridden. Our source code follows WP coding standards and is properly commented. We are working on a documentation site which will be available soon.
